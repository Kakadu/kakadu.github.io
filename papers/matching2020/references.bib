abstract="We derive a compiler for ML-style pattern matches. It is conceptually simple and produces reasonably good compiled matches. The derivation is inspired by the instrumentation and partial evaluation of na{\"I}ve string matchers. Following that paradigm, we first present a general and na{\"I}ve ML pattern matcher, instrument it to collect and exploit extra information, and show that partial evaluation of the instrumented general matcher with respect to a given match produces an efficient specialized matcher.",

abstract="We define a General Pattern Matching problem and we show that several compiling problems in programming languages, like pattern Matching in ML and the calling mechanism of Prolog can be formalized as instances of the General Pattern Matching problem. As a consequence of this, the solutions of the general problem which are compiling algorithms can be instantiated into compiling algorithms for the instances. In particular, the proof of the decidability of the existence of optimal solutions is a proof of the decidability of the instances. This approach can be used for the meta-compilation of pattern-matching problems, for the implementation of languages or systems that contain different instances of the general problem and for the implementation of systems using Call by Name style of evaluation for which completeness and optimality are equivalent.",

abstract = {We investigate the algorithmics of subtyping in the presence of nominal inheritance and variance for generic types, as found in Java 5, Scala 2.0, and the .NET 2.0 Intermediate Language. We prove that the general problem is undecidable and characterize three different decidable fragments. From the latter, we conjecture that undecidability critically depends on the combination of three features that are not found together in any of these languages: contravariant type constructors, class hierarchies in which the set of types reachable from a given type by inheritance and decomposition is not always finite, and class hierarchies in which a type may have multiple supertypes with the same head constructor. These results settle one case of practical interest: subtyping between ground types in the .NET intermediate language is decidable; we conjecture that our proof can also be extended to show full decidability of subtyping in .NET. For Java and Scala, the decidability questions remain open; however, the proofs of our preliminary results introduce a number of novel techniques that we hope may be useful in further attacks on these questions.},
