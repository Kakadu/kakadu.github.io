abstract="Functional programs are merely equations; they may be manipulated by straightforward equational reasoning. In particular, one can use this style of reasoning to calculate programs, in the same way that one calculates numeric values in arithmetic. Many useful theorems for such reasoning derive from an algebraic view of programs, built around datatypes and their operations. Traditional algebraic methods concentrate on initial algebras, constructors, and values; dual co-algebraic methods concentrate on final co-algebras, destructors, and processes. Both methods are elegant and powerful; they deserve to be combined.",

abstract="``Meaning'' may be assigned to a string in a context-free language by defining ``attributes'' of the symbols in a derivation tree for that string. The attributes can be defined by functions associated with each production in the grammar. This paper examines the implications of this process when some of the attributes are ``synthesized'', i.e., defined solely in terms of attributes of thedescendants of the corresponding nonterminal symbol, while other attributes are ``inherited'', i.e., defined in terms of attributes of theancestors of the nonterminal symbol. An algorithm is given which detects when such semantic rules could possibly lead to circular definition of some attributes. An example is given of a simple programming language defined with both inherited and synthesized attributes, and the method of definition is compared to other techniques for formal specification of semantics which have appeared in the literature.",

abstract="Tony Hoare has always been a leader in writing down and proving properties of programs. To prove properties of programs automatically, the most widely used technology today is the ubiquitous type checker. Alas, static type systems inevitably exclude some good programs and allow some bad ones. Thus motivated, we describe some fun we have been having with Haskell, by making the type system more expressive without losing the benefits of automatic proof and compact expression. Specifically, we offer a programmer's tour of so-calledtype families, a recent extension to Haskell that allows functions on types to be expressed as straightforwardly as functions on values. This facility makes it easier for programmers to effectively extend the compiler by writing functional programs that execute during type checking. Source code for all the examples is available at http://research.microsoft.com/simonpj/papers/assoc-types/fun-with-type-funs.zip.",
