[CORRECTNESS OF UNIFICATION WITHOUT OCCUR CHECK IN PROLOG](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743106694900485) (Journal of Logic Programming, 1994)

Occurs check make unification to work much slowly but without it unification may 
lead to wrong answers. Folks invent a way to preprocess Prolog programs to detect
which terms can be recursive and use occurs-check unification only for this terms.

Some prolog [implementations](https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/3.12.8/html/sicstus/Occur.html) seems be able to deal with terms with cycles without cyclicing the programm. Some dirty hack probably....
