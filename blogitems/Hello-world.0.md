Hey, there! SP have recently released the new version of his blog engine called 
Logarion which supports generation of static pages from now. So, I decided to give 
it a try. I have a few ideas what I'm going to write there but I don't expect that 
the result will be interesting (it's kind of difficult to do a good writing) but I 
hope that your eyes flow out. 

As I said I have a few ideas what to put here. The main is to replace my enormous
amount of opened Firefox tabs by somehow systemized entries. I hope create to some blog entries each of them will be a collection of links with some descriptions. I hope that is will work fine, at least I have a lot of topics to systematize. 

It's planned to have a few categories, most of them will be about functional programming, or teaching functional programming, and stuff like this.
