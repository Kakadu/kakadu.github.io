Categories: listed, published

There I collect an unsorted list of teaching materials (slides, tasks, etc.) that seems to describe the topic well enough or useful in general.

[Resolution and logic programming](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs3234/cs3234-lec05.pdf)

Fold/Unfold exercises

A few remarks and explanations why combination of fold/unfold is an assembly of functional programming. Initial topic on 
[OCaml discuss server](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/how-to-unfold-unfold-what-is-a-good-source/). Nice 
[slides](http://conal.net/talks/folds-and-unfolds.pdf) from Conal Eliott. And a [reply](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/how-to-unfold-unfold-what-is-a-good-source/2039/7) explaining why the signature can't be 
simplified.

[Original paper about monads](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf) by P.Wadler has a few examples which are being generalized by using a monad. Looks like very easy to read for engineers.
 
### Functional programming books

[Functional Data Structures](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/index.html) (a fl√¢nerie by Prabhakar Ragde)
with OCaml in mind: sorting, sequence access, queues, sets and maps, hashconsing.

### Really unsorted

Talk [Demystifying functional programming and what that means for learning & teaching](http://nights.yowconference.com.au/archive-2018/yow-night-2018-sydney-manuel-chakravarty-mar-6/) from Manuel Chakravarty.
