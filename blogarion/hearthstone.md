Witchwood is out. I opened 70 + 16 packs.
The last opened pack contained and a legendary card. So, now I have 
1 (free) + 4 other legendary cards. I got `1+86*5=271` card and after 
disenchanting duplicated and golden I raise from 4410 dust to 6940
dust (2530 dust from duplicates and golden cards in 86 packs).
